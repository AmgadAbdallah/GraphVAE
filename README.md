# GraphVAE

This is a trial to one-shot generation of molecules using graph variational autoencoder. This trial was aiming to examine the task of
generating molecules using graph variational autoencoder and compare it with other approaches (e.g.: GANs), and notice how stable they are in dealing with diffrent 
datasets, the diffculties in training, how to introduce Deep Reinforcement Learning to these architectures for molecular optimization, and much more.

#### This isn't fully functioning yet, it was designed for the sake of investigations during my MSc. thesis.
